[Paragraph 1]
Junk removal is an on-demand service to have just about any kind of trash or unwanted items removed from your home or business. We'll haul away junk from anywhere on your property, so you don't have to worry about the heavy lifting.

[Paragraph 2]
We take a wide variety of items, including furniture, appliances, electronics, yard waste, construction debris, and more. If you're not sure about a specific item, just ask! There are a few things we can't take due to safety or legal regulations.

[Paragraph 3]
For safety and regulatory reasons, we cannot accept hazardous materials like paint, chemicals, asbestos, or certain types of batteries. We also don't handle medical waste. If you have hazardous materials, we can guide you to a local facility that specializes in their disposal.

[Paragraph 4]
Our pricing is based on the volume of junk you need to be removed. We offer free, no-obligation on-site estimates.

[Paragraph 5]
Yes, every junk removal job requires a quote before we can begin. We provide these quotes either over the phone, through text, or by using the form on our website. This ensures that the price is accurate and that there are no surprises on the day of service.

[Paragraph 6]
We'll deliver the dumpster to your specified location on the scheduled date. Once you've filled it, simply let us know, and we'll come and pick it up. You don't need to be present for either delivery or pickup, but being on-site for drop-off is a plus so we can ensure the placement is exactly where you want it.

[Paragraph 7]
You only pay for the dumpster size you rent, regardless of how much you fill it. The price is based on the container size and weight allowance, not the amount of junk inside. So, whether you fill it halfway or to the top, the rental fee remains the same as long as you stay within the weight limit.

[Paragraph 8]
Our dumpsters are perfect for a wide range of projects. They can handle most household cleanouts, renovation debris, yard waste, and construction materials. The size you choose depends on the scope of your project, from a small 10-yard dumpster for a single-room remodel to a large 40-yard dumpster for major construction or demolition.

[Paragraph 9]
Our standard rental period is 7-10 days. However, we're flexible! If you need the dumpster for a longer or shorter period, just let us know when you book your rental. We can often accommodate custom rental periods to fit your project timeline.

[Paragraph 10]
Every dumpster size has a set weight limit included in the rental price. If the weight of your load exceeds this limit, a per-ton overage fee will be applied. We'll inform you of the exact overage charge after the dumpster is picked up and weighed at the landfill. To avoid extra fees, please refer to the weight limit specified for your chosen dumpster size.

[Paragraph 11]
We understand that plans can change. You can cancel or reschedule your rental by calling us. For a full refund, please provide at least 24 hours' notice before your scheduled delivery. Cancellations made less than 24 hours in advance may be subject to a cancellation fee.

[Paragraph 12]
In most cases, a permit is not required if the dumpster is placed on private property, like your driveway. However, if you plan to place the dumpster on a public street, sidewalk, or other public right-of-way, you may need a permit from your local municipality or homeowner's association. We recommend checking with your local authorities beforehand.

[Paragraph 13]
For safety and regulatory reasons, we cannot accept hazardous materials. This includes, but is not limited to:

[Paragraph 14]
If you have any of these items, please dispose of them through a designated hazardous waste facility.

[Paragraph 15]
Our friendly AI chatbot, the Fill-osopher, is here 24/7 to answer your dumpster rental and junk removal questions.
